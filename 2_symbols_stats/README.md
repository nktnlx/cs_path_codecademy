The script was coded by me during completion of Codecademy Computer Science Career Path: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science  


symbols_stats.py:  
- reads a txt file provided as an optional argument when running the script  
- asks whether you want to make a case sensitive or case insensitive search  
- parses the file and calculates frequency of each symbol occurances  
- prints each symbol ranked based on its occurance in the text from the most frequent to the least frequent  
- shows the total amount of symbols in the file   


Optional arguments:  
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit  
  --filename FILENAME  name of a txt file to count symbols  


The directory contains a test txt file to run the script as follows:  
$ python3 words_stats.py --filename=millay_sonnet.txt  

NB! The txt file has to be in the same working directory as the script file.  


The code was created using Python 3.7.6  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line) as shown in examples above.
