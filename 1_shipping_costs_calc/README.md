The script was coded by me during completion of Codecademy Computer Science Career Path: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science  


The shipping costs calculator:  
- prints tariffs for different shipping methods in a table view  
- takes a weight of a parcel to be shipped from a user input   
- calculates shipping costs for different shipping methods   
- prints the most cost-effective shipping solution for the customer  


The code was created using Python 3.7.6  
If your machine has an installed Python 3, you can run the code in terminal(command line) by typing:   
$ python3 shipping_costs_calc.py
