The script was coded by me during completion of Codecademy Computer Science Career Path: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science  


The 'Days count' script:  
- prints out an info about today and the current year progress status  
- or tells a user how many days are left till user's birthday and how young is the user based on the user's input  
- the output is as below:  

```

    1 - for info ABOUT TODAY,
